<h1 align='center'> (Early) Data Mining - Breast Cancer Analysis </h1>

<hr>

Here is a project I conducted for my data mining module. Much of the coding was conducted in the early stages of my Python learning. Please note that the code is not clean or up to industry standard.

A 3D dataset of 11 features is used. Each feature details a different cancer feature related to cells, such as 'clump thickness' or 'uniformity of cell size'. Principle component analysis is applied to the dataset and the results visualised. All 11 features are passed throigh 2 components. As a result, two clear classifications can be observed. The variance ratio suggests that data is quite clustered agreeing with the visualisation.
